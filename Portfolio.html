            <h2>1. Project Data Management in Healthcare in Ghana</h2>
            <p class="port_para1"> In Ghana, the healthcare sector is hindered by inconsistent and inefficient data management
                systems, outdated practices, and inadequate infrastructure. This leads to erroneous
                government decisions and inefficiencies in public service delivery, particularly in the
                healthcare sector. The inadequate data management system affects a wide range of
                stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, administrators, government bodies,
                and healthcare IT professionals. It also indirectly impacts patients' families and caregivers,
                insurance companies, pharmaceutical and medical device companies. </p>  
                
            <p class="port_para2"> The resistance to using technology in healthcare centers due to a lack of IT infrastructure and personnel results
                in a preference for manual data entry, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and incomplete medical
                records. This hampers clinical decision support. Implementing proper data management
                systems would lead to improved patient care, streamlined operations, enhanced data security,
                support for research and public health initiatives, and empower patients. These positive
                changes would result in better healthcare outcomes, greater access to services, and a more
                efficient and effective healthcare system in Ghana. </p>
